In this example, the create_invoice view handles the creation of new invoices. You would create a template
(create_invoice.html) to display the form for users to input invoice details. When the form is submitted, the view
processes the data, creates an Invoice object, and saves it to the database. You can then build upon this foundation to
add features such as invoice listing, payment tracking, and invoice generation.
